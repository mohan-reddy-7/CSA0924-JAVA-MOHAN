Java Program to Find Transpose of Matrix
Last Updated : 31 Jul, 2023
Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows. In other words, the transpose of A[][] is obtained by changing A[i][j] to A[j][i].

Transpose of a matrix
Find Transpose of a Matrix in Java
There are two shapes in Matrix to find transpose as mentioned below:

Square Matrix
Rectangle Matrix
1. Transpose of Square Matrix
The below program finds the transpose of A[][] and stores the result in B[][], we can change N for different dimensions. 

Below is the implementation of the above method:
Java
// Java Program to find 
// transpose of a matrix 
  
class GFG { 
    static final int N = 4; 
  
    // This function stores transpose 
    // of A[][] in B[][] 
    static void transpose(int A[][], int B[][]) 
    { 
        int i, j; 
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) 
            for (j = 0; j < N; j++) 
                B[i][j] = A[j][i]; 
    } 
  
    // Driver code 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        int A[][] = { { 1, 1, 1, 1 }, 
                      { 2, 2, 2, 2 }, 
                      { 3, 3, 3, 3 }, 
                      { 4, 4, 4, 4 } }; 
  
        int B[][] = new int[N][N], i, j; 
  
        transpose(A, B); 
  
        System.out.print("Result matrix is \n"); 
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
            for (j = 0; j < N; j++) 
                System.out.print(B[i][j] + " "); 
            System.out.print("\n"); 
        }
